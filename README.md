## Authors' Notes

This fully responsive app was built with developers in mind. The goal was to add some missing functionality to npm. This app gives the user the ability to save favorite or commonly used packages for later use.

## Features to come

- A way for users to share collections.
- A way for users to setup teams to allow for collaboration.
- A dedicated collection page so that there is a larger format to view collections from.
- The unification of our package API.
